Syntax file for EBNF as specified by ISO/IEC 14977 : 1996(E)

EBNF is slightly different from most homegrown BNF.  Terminals are always quoted, non-terminals are not (and may contain spaces). Kleene closure is achieved by enclosing with braces, 0-or-1 matches with brackets, 1-or-more matches by appending "-" to the end of the braces (i.e. {one non-terminal, second non-terminal}- ). Atoms are separated by "," or "|". A production rule ends with ";" or ".". Comments are (* comment *)
